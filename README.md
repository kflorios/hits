HITS: Hyperplanes Intersection Tabu Search for maximum score estimation

# Description

Hyperplanes Intersection Tabu Search (HITS) is a program that calculates the Maximum Score Estimator (MS) of the binary choice model (Manski, 1975; 1985). It is a variant of Tabu Search (TS) method (Glover, 1989) especially modified for MS. Specifically, it uses the gaussian elimination to locate the trial points of hyperplanes intersections (Pinkse, 1993). It uses the concept of “Neighbourhood” which is popular in trajectory-based methods of combinatorial optimization in order to search nearby solutions of the current solution and avoid complete enumeration. It also uses a “Tabu List” as a short-term memory of prohibited neighbouring solutions to which the search is prevented from moving to. The program is coded in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 with Visual C++.
